This is a __fork__ of the original hollyhock launcher by The6P4C (https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork/).
My intention is to modify it a little. I want to change the following things:
- Exam mode: The Launcher should be disabled in exam mode to prevent cheating. (My math teacher in school wants this function) 
             I will check the color of the battery logo to test, if the exam mode is on or off.
- EXEC003:   I want to add the ability to run programs located in program variables. This was the function of the old "LoaderIIb", which I wrote a few month back.
             I don't want to miss the feel of typing in programs byte per byte by hand (only if you want to) and sending them over the serial cable.
- Strings:   I want to change a few texts in the OS, the Imaginary Unit button used to load the program should be renamed. The version text (usually "classpad II")
             Was changed to "hollyhock" by The6P4C, I will change it to "hollyhock2" (or something similar) only after i patched the exam mode thing.

# Installation (simple)
This is how you install hollyhock-2 onto your calculator:
- download the newest prebuild release of hollyhock-2: https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/releases
- extract the folder Snail2021 from the release onto the desktop.
- open the folder Snail2021 on the desktor and double click on Snail2021.exe
- follow the instructions on screen:
  - Download and install ResourceHacker (scroll down, click on _EXE install_): http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/
  - Download the official updater version 02.01.2 (click the green download button): https://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_voir.php?id=1044960
  - Follow the instructions in the updater, but don't connect the calculator when it asks you to.
- at this point, return back to the first windown (The Snail2021.exe)
- click enter until it asks you to connect the calculator.
- You can close the updater window now.
- When you click enter the last time in the Snail2021.exe window, the updater will open again.
- Connect the calculator via USB.
- On the calculator hold down the [EXP], [^] and Clear keys. With those keys depressed, momentarily press the RESET button on the back of the calculator. Keep the three front buttons pressed until the screen displays the `OS ERROR` message. Don't worry, there is no actual error, this is just the update mode.
- On the computer, Click on OK in the updater. 
- __DO NOT TOUCH__ the calculator until the update is finished.
- When the updater is finished, unplug it and plug it in again
- Select USB Storage and copy the file run.bin and all .hhk files (from the folder Snail2021) directly onto the calculator.
- On the computer, click on eject (probably on the bottom right) and eject the calculator.

To start a program, go to the Menu, go to the right, select System, click on the gear on the top left and click on `Imaginary Unit` (I will probably rename this to 'Start hollyhock' or 'Start program' soon.)

Select the program and click OK.


# hollyhock
An SDK to write your own applications for the CASIO fx-CP400 graphics calculator.

This is by no means a finished project. Like the disclaimer says, use at your own risk! Breaking changes are not out of the question, and should be 100% expected.

I (@The6P4C) have burned out *hard* on this project, and won't be maintaining it any further. These tools, patches and SDK work only for OS v02.01.2000.0000. The tools are easily updated, but the patches and SDK are **much** more difficult (and half the reason I'm so burned out).

~~Please contact @ps100000 regarding this project.~~ If you have any questions, you can visit our discord https://discord.com/invite/fWxZXvy or comment on YouTube.
